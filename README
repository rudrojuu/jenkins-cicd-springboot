# Jenkins CI/CD Demo 🚀
This repository contains selected projects from the **Jenkins Zero to Hero** series that I implemented while learning DevOps. It demonstrates how to build, analyze, and deploy a Spring Boot application using a complete CI/CD pipeline.

## 🔧 Workflow
- Build Spring Boot application with **Java + Maven**  
- Perform static code analysis with **SonarQube**  
- Automate pipeline with **Jenkins**  
- Containerize and deploy with **Docker & Kubernetes**  
- Use **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based deployment  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/` → CI/CD pipeline scripts  
- `spring-boot-app/` → Spring Boot source code  
- `spring-boot-app-manifests/` → Kubernetes manifests  

## 🏗️ Tools & Technologies
:
.Jenkins
· Maven
· SonarQube
· Docker
· Kubernetes
· ArgoCD  

## 🌟 Learning Outcome
- Set up Jenkins pipelines from scratch  
- Integrated SonarQube for quality checks  
- Deployed Spring Boot app into Kubernetes  
- Practiced GitOps with ArgoCD  

## 🤝 Credits
Inspired by **Abhishek Veramalla’s Jenkins Zero to Hero**, customized and implemented by me for hands-on learning.
